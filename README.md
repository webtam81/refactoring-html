# refactoring-html
Refactoring a web page to make it more accesible and seo friendly

text/css added to stylesheet tag

changed div class header/footer to header footer tags and adjusted accordingly

changed class "seo" to "contrast-letters" as seo means nothing with regards to the style. removed header selector for this in css so it can be used elsewhere in the page too.

Changed divs to sections and articles

Changed page ttitle to be descriptive

created services block class to merge repeated css for each 3 blocks

created benefit block class to merge repeated css for each 3 blocks 

side section made into aside

h2 in footer changed to p. Wouldn't have a heading in the footer, it's not heading anything
